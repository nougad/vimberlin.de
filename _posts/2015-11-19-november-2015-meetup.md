## Topics

We will talk about using [vim](http://www.vim.org/ "vim") with [screen window manager](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/ "screen window manager") and [tmux](http://tmux.github.io/ "tmux"). This meetup will exchange workflows, shortcuts and the setup of your dotfiles. Please bring your laptop with you, so that we can hack together.
