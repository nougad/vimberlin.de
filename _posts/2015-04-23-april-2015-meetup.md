## Talks

- **"Vim Banshee - a command line wrapper for Banshee"** by [Matthias GÃ¼nther](https://twitter.com/wikimatze)<br>
Based on [Ben Klein's](https://twitter.com/fifthposition) book [The VimL Primer: Edit Like a Pro with Vim Plugins and Scripts](https://pragprog.com/book/bkviml/the-viml-primer) I started to write this plugin and I want to go through it and explain it.
